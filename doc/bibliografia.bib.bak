  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new and fast technique for background
	estimation from cluttered image sequences. Most of the background
	initialization approaches developed so far collect a number of initial
	frames and then require a slow estimation step which introduces a
	delay whenever it is applied. Conversely, the proposed technique
	redistributes the computational load among all the frames by means
	of a patch by patch preprocessing, which makes the overall algorithm
	more suitable for real-time applications. For each patch location
	a prototype set is created and maintained. The background is then
	iteratively estimated by choosing from each set the most appropriate
	candidate patch, which should verify a sort of frequency coherence
	with its neighbors. To this aim, the Hadamard transform has been
	adopted which requires less computation time than the commonly used
	DCT Finally, a refinement step exploits spatial continuity constraints
	along the patch borders to prevent erroneous patch selections. The
	approach has been compared with the state of the art on videos from
	available datasets (ViSOR and CAVIAR), showing a speed up of about
	10 times and an improved accuracy.},

  abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms such as object tracking and event
	detection assume that a background model of the scene under analysis
	is known. However, in many practical circumstances it is unavailable
	and must be estimated from cluttered image sequences. We propose
	a sequential technique for background estimation in such conditions,
	with low computational and memory requirements. The first stage is
	somewhat similar to that of the recently proposed agglomerative clustering
	background estimation method, where image sequences are analysed
	on a patch by patch basis. For each patch location a representative
	set is maintained which contains distinct patches obtained along
	its temporal line. The novelties lie in iteratively filling in background
	areas by selecting the most appropriate candidate patches according
	to the combined frequency responses of extended versions of the candidate
	patch and its neigh-bourhood. It is assumed that the most appropriate
	patch results in the smoothest response, indirectly enforcing the
	spatial continuity of structures within a scene. Experiments on real-life
	surveillance videos demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {A common method for real-time segmentation of moving regions in image

	the error between an estimate of the image without moving objects

	in the type of background model used and the procedure used to update
	the model. This paper discusses modeling each pixel as a mixture
	of Gaussians and using an on-line approximation to update the model.
	The Gaussian, distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then
	evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background
	process. Each pixel is classified based on whether the Gaussian distribution
	which represents it most effectively is considered part of the background
	model. This results in a stable, real-time outdoor tracker which
	reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter,
	and long-term scene changes. This system has been run almost continuously
	for 16 months, 24 hours a day, through rain and snow},

	initialize a background model using a training video sequence which

	foreground objects. In such a case, robust statistical methods are
	required
	
	to handle random occurrences of foreground objects (i.e., outliers),
	as well as
	
	general image noise. The robust statistical method Median has been

	for initializing the background model. However, the Median can tolerate

	only 50% outliers, which cannot satisfy the requirements of some complicated
	
	environments. In this paper, we propose a novel robust method for
